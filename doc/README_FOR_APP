Instructions to run and test product

To run product:
1. Open Heroku link
2. Type or copy & paste text into the resume text field
   * We are still working on parsing attachment files, so ignore this part of the view
     for now. This part is not part of our MVP, but it will be fleshed out for iteration
     2.
3. Click on 'Upload Resume'
4. Now, Paste your job description into the job description field.
5. Click on the green 'T(ai)lor!' button
6. Once your resume has been T(ai)lored, download your new tailored resume!
   * We are still working on the resume editor button, so ignore this as it is not part 
     of the MVP. The goal is that users are able to view and edit their newly tailored
     resume to ensure accuracy.
7. Verify that your resume now is better tailored to the job description than it was
   before.

only /uploaded works, /editor and /resume do not work. They do work on 
the codio servers though.
